# DeepLearningTextSentiment
The objective of this project is to analyze the sentiment of movie reviews in three different languages - English, French, and Spanish. We have been given 30 movies, 10 in each language, along with their reviews and synopses in separate CSV files named movie_reviews_eng.csv, movie_reviews_fr.csv, and movie_reviews_sp.csv.
